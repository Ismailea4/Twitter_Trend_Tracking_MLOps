DistantMemory96,2025-04-02T17:37:09.000Z,Why couldn’t you guys just give us the “Wii U” port of “Wind Waker HD” on a physical game card? Why couldn’t we just get “F-Zero GX” with those “HD upgrades” on a physical card too? Oh! Wait! I know why! You guys are greedy and would rather they be locked behind a pay wall!!!,0,0,2,0,217
