efferr92,2025-02-15T03:33:03.000Z,I've preordered the S23U in 2023 because I was promised a flagship device with 4 generations of OS updates. Seeing now that midrange phones from way smaller companies have gotten Android 15 for months now makes me realize that this is my last Samsung phone.,0,0,15,0,519

I was a loyal Fan of Samsung, but this greedy behavior to hold back the One UI 7 Update to push S25 sales is unacceptable. You promised 7 Years of update support for the customer.

heibanbaize,2025-02-18T14:52:53.000Z,我看到大家都在用母语骂，那我就不翻译了，三星的妈妈就是死掉了，这些韩国棒子一个个都掉到钱眼里面去了，就是明确的知道S25相比S24没有任何升级，所以要生硬的制造卖点，OneUI7给独占个几个月，建议卢泰文的母亲在下葬的时候坟墓也独占几个月，真司马东西，不想想这样能丢失多少老用户。,0,0,9,0,462

Release an official statement about the shift in SW updates that do not undermine the Intelligence of your customers, bug fixes as in color calibrations in a mode that 1% of users use and was spotted 1 month later after the latest beta is not an excuse.
