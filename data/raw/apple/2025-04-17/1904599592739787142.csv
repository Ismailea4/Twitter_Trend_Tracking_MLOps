tslecomte,2025-03-25T20:05:40.000Z,"I am very excited.

Honestly a little nervous about the ""massive and complete"" overhaul of iOS, but it's time for the refresh.

I hope they figure a way to make the round (more transparent) Vision Pro icons work in 2D on the iPhone and iPad.

Still very exciting. ",0,0,3,0,2502
